(1) Make a ML model using classification, specifically KNN.

	(A) Research, figure out how to make the model.
	(B) Figure out how to change the part of the KNN algo,
	    where we will use avg of K neighbours instead of 
	    majority method.
	(C) Figure out what value of K we will be using



(3) Implement the trained model on the original dataset (dataset1), so that it  
    can generate a column(feature) for that dataset: the Impact Energy.




(4) Figure out what to do further, with the user's input etc.
	
	(A) Discussion. Use KNN on just new input provided, and use
	    trained model to predict that? But what data to use for
	    training and which features to add, what class(es) to 
 	    predict? Can multiple classes be predicted, would we 
	    have to design different models for that?



DONE----------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Use impact energy to calc mass instead of the radiated energy that u used Pehle.


(2) Adjust units of 2 columns:
	
	(A) Total Impact Energy:
		Change the unit to Kg
		Multiply entire column's values with 1000,000(1 million - 6 zeroes)

	(B) Mass: 
		Set unit to Kg.

On dataset1 (csv):


    	(A) Add Mass feature.

		-> Step 1: Add column for density.

		-> Step 2: Add column for Mass
			-> Mass = Density/Volume
			-> Volume of sphere = 4/3 * pi * r^3


	(B) Add Velocity Feature.

		-> Velocity = sqrt((2 * G * M)/(C * A * ρ))


EXTRA INFO:


DENSITIES (adjust units accordingly):

Crystalline rocks: 2.95 g/cm³ 
Sedimentary rocks: 2.4 g/cm³
Metasedimentary: 2.65 g/cm³
Mixed: 5 g/cm^3

where:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
G = the gravitational constant (6.67430 × 10^-11 N*m^2/kg^2)
M = the mass of the meteoroid (kg)
C = the drag coefficient (typically around 1.0 for a spherical object)
A = the cross-sectional area of the meteoroid (m^2)
ρ = the density of the meteoroid (kg/m^3)
Assuming that the meteoroid is spherical, its cross-sectional area can be calculated as:

A = π * (d/2)^2

where d is the diameter of the meteoroid.

Therefore, the formula can be rewritten as:
2
Velocity = sqrt((8 * G * π * M)/(3 * C * ρ * d^2))
