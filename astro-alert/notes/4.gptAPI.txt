              Your task is to predict the effect of the meteor impact on the city and its surrounding areas.
              Only provide statistical data in your answer. This should be done according to following factors of the 
              city:
              Population, size, population density, terrain, geographical location, civilization,
              infrastructure, etc.
              Your answer should be concise, and rich with numerical and statistical data. Also, conduct a 
              hypothetical statistical analysis of the meteor impact."""
